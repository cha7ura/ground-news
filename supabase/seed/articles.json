That means you can earn more than 120% annually. Therefore, people should realize that if such a profit can be made from an investment, they could do it themselves.”\n\n“There is no need to give your money to someone else to do it. However, we all know that this is practically impossible to achieve.”\n\nWeerasinghe said the Central Bank has observed an increasing trend of the public being lured toward fraudulent investment schemes in plantations and agriculture sectors.\n\n“The first thing to remember is that plantation investments are unregulated. If you lose your money, there is no regulatory authority to handle your complaint. This is an entirely unregulated sector,” Weerasinghe warned.\n\nHe said people are being promised of deeds for the cultivation they have invested after signing contracts, citing to protect individual investments.\n\nCurrently 18 individuals or organizations are being investigated related such investments which are considered as illegal deposits, he said.

Upatissa Thero.\n\nThe Ministry further confirmed that no conflict occurred between the Minister and the former Chairman regarding this matter and emphasized that the letter was not connected to Abeywickrama’s removal.\n\nCommenting on the situation, Minister Karunathilaka stated:\n\n“Various discussions have emerged in society, but there is no connection between the incident and the permit issued to Ven. Banagala Upatissa Thero. There was no conflict between me, as the Minister, and the Chairman regarding this letter. When I made the request, there was an explanation from the Airport Authority’s side, which I accepted. However, I instructed them to issue an authorization letter in a manner that fulfilled the Ven. Thero’s requirement. The Authority acted accordingly, and that incident ended there.”\n\nMinister Karunathilaka further stated that the events occurred in the first week of January and that, subsequently, there was a need to implement administrative changes. \n\nHe added that during discussions on January 21, he had indicated that a change in administration was necessary, and, as a result, action was taken to remove the AASL Chairman from the position.\n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

The claims appear in draft notes Epstein wrote to himself and are part of a wider release of Epstein-related records under a new transparency law.\n\nAccording to the documents, Epstein made the allegation in a 225-word email dated July 18, 2013, with the subject line ‘bill’. The email was sent by Epstein to himself. However, there is no clear indication regarding whether it was ever shared with Gates, reported the New York Times.\n\nThe new tranche of records, largely emails in the Data Set 12 includes mentions of former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Elon Musk among others, reports the Associated Press.\n\n**Epstein draft emails mention Bill Gates**\n\nAmong the records are draft emails attributed to Jeffrey Epstein from 2013 in which he implied that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates engaged in extramarital sexual relations and sought to handle personal matters discreetly.\n\nIn one draft, Epstein described Gates, allegedly having contracted a sexually transmitted infection following encounters with ‘Russian girls’ and mentioned attempts to obtain antibiotics that could be provided secretly to Gates’s then-wife, Melinda French Gates, as reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe New York Times reported that it is unclear if Epstein sent the July 2013 emails to the Microsoft founder. A representative of the Gates Foundation said their claims were ‘absolutely absurd and completely false.’\n\n**Bill Gates spokesperson denies allegation**\n\nA spokesperson for Bill Gates strongly rejected the assertions contained in the documents, calling them ‘absolutely absurd and completely false.’ The spokesperson said the claims reflect Epstein’s frustration and attempts to defame Gates, and not a verified fact, reported the New York Times.\n\nGates previously acknowledged in 2021 that he had met Epstein on several occasions in the hope of securing philanthropic funding, a decision he later described as ‘a mistake’.\n\nAs per a report by the New York Times, in a 2021 interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Gates called his relationship with the disgraced financier “a huge mistake.” He also sought to downplay his interactions with Epstein, saying he had several dinners with Epstein, with the hope of getting him to generate donations to the Gates Foundation.\n\n**Largest single day disclousre says DoJ Deputy Attorney**\n\nThe United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has published more than 3 million pages of documents, images and videos connected to its investigations of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release comes under the new Epstein Files Transparency Act passed by the US Congress and signed into law in November 2025.\n\nUnited States Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the disclosure which includes over 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, marks the largest single release of material to date from the Epstein files, while addressing a press conference on Friday.\n\nThe documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n**Source: Indian Express**\n\n_\\--Agencies_\n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

That means you can earn more than 120% annually. Therefore, people should realize that if such a profit can be made from an investment, they could do it themselves.”\n\n“There is no need to give your money to someone else to do it. However, we all know that this is practically impossible to achieve.”\n\nWeerasinghe said the Central Bank has observed an increasing trend of the public being lured toward fraudulent investment schemes in plantations and agriculture sectors.\n\n“The first thing to remember is that plantation investments are unregulated. If you lose your money, there is no regulatory authority to handle your complaint. This is an entirely unregulated sector,” Weerasinghe warned.\n\nHe said people are being promised of deeds for the cultivation they have invested after signing contracts, citing to protect individual investments.\n\nCurrently 18 individuals or organizations are being investigated related such investments which are considered as illegal deposits, he said.

Instead, it highlighted his struggles. In the opening T20I against England, he scored 11 off 12 balls in an 11-run defeat, failing to provide momentum at a crucial stage of the innings.\n\nKamindu Mendis is reportedly the likely replacement. Previously dropped from the ongoing England series, the left-hander’s ability to bat in multiple positions and adapt to different match situations is seen as a valuable asset in tournament conditions.\n\nSpeaking to Newswire last night, international commentator Russell Arnold said Dhananjaya de Silva’s current form remains a major concern.\n\n“A player like Dhananjaya is useful because of his all-round ability, especially in Sri Lankan conditions,” Arnold said. “But with his present form, his place in the team is a big question.”\n\nSri Lanka Cricket is yet to formally announce the final squad, with confirmation expected before the ICC deadline expires later today.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs.

Thousands have been killed, and about 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.\n\n![YANGON, BURMA - JANUARY 26: Local newspapers feature headlines covering the conclusion of Myanmar's general election on January 26, 2026 in Yangon, Burma. Myanmar concluded its multi-phase general election on January 25, 2026, after voting began on December 28, 2025, under the military administration that took power in the 2021 coup and has overseen the country amid ongoing conflict.

The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nU 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals\n==========================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n8 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal.png)\n\nFaisal Khan's 163 came off just 142 balls \\[Cricinfo\\]\n\nFaisal Khan’s extraordinary century was the highlight of Afghanistan’s historic win over Ireland that helped them seal their spot in the semifinals. Faisal hit a belligerent 163 off 142 deliveries after walking out to bat by the end of the third over. He almost batted through the innings and was dismissed only in the 48th over. He was involved in a mammoth partnership with Mahboob Khan who hit 89 off just 79 balls.\n\nEven though Ireland did pick up a few late wickets, the damage was already done as Afghanistan managed to breach 300 and put themselves in a strong position. Abdul Aziz then came out with the ball to put Ireland under more pressure. Having made just 7 runs from the first four overs, Ireland were reduced to 21/3 in the ninth over with Aziz striking twice.\n\nThe wickets continued to tumble as Ireland lost half their side for just 53. Marko Bates and Reuben Wilson arrested the slide for a brief period with a fighting half-century partnership but it only managed to delay the inevitable. From 108/5 to 124 all out, Ireland succumbed real quick to lose the contest by a massive margin of 191 runs.\n\n**Brief scores**:  \n**Afghanistan Under 19s**  315/7 in 50 overs (Faisal Khan 163,

Thousands have been killed, and about 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.\n\n![YANGON, BURMA - JANUARY 26: Local newspapers feature headlines covering the conclusion of Myanmar's general election on January 26, 2026 in Yangon, Burma.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs. But GG clawed back, with Gayakwad getting Amanjot Kaur stumped and Wareham trapping Sanskriti Gupta for a first-ball duck. Harmanpreet ended the night with the Orange Cap on her head, but it was the team in orange that progressed to the next round.\n\nBrief scores:  \n**Gujarat Giants Women** 167 for 4 in 20 overs (Sophie Devine 25, Anushka Sharma 33, Ashleigh Gardner 46, Georgia Wareham 44\\*; Shabnim Ismail 1-29, Nat Sciver Brunt 1-36, Amelia  Kerr 2-26) _beat_ **Mumbai Indians Women**  156 for 7 in 20 overs  (Sajeevan Sajana 26, Harmanpreet Kaur 82\\*, Amelia Kerr 20, Amanjot Kaur 13; Kashvee Gautam  1-12, Rajeshwari Gayakwad  1-46, Sophie Devine 2-23, Georgia Wareham 2-26, Ashleigh Gardner 1-26) _**by 11 runs**_\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nICC and World Cricketers Association clash over player terms ahead of T20 World Cup\n===================================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n6 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tom-Moffart.png)\n\nTom Moffat, World Cricketers Association CEO, has written to the players expressing his concerns \\[Cricinfo\\]\n\nThe ICC and the global players’ body the World Cricketers Association (WCA) are locked in a fresh tussle over player terms, including name, image and likeness (NIL) rights, ahead of the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup.\n\nThe WCA claims the ICC has sent a version of the squad participation terms to players from several countries in the tournament that does not align with an agreed version signed by both bodies in 2024. The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nU 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals\n==========================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n8 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal.png)\n\nFaisal Khan's 163 came off just 142 balls \\[Cricinfo\\]\n\nFaisal Khan’s extraordinary century was the highlight of Afghanistan’s historic win over Ireland that helped them seal their spot in the semifinals. Faisal hit a belligerent 163 off 142 deliveries after walking out to bat by the end of the third over. He almost batted through the innings and was dismissed only in the 48th over. He was involved in a mammoth partnership with Mahboob Khan who hit 89 off just 79 balls.\n\nEven though Ireland did pick up a few late wickets, the damage was already done as Afghanistan managed to breach 300 and put themselves in a strong position. Abdul Aziz then came out with the ball to put Ireland under more pressure. Having made just 7 runs from the first four overs, Ireland were reduced to 21/3 in the ninth over with Aziz striking twice.\n\nThe wickets continued to tumble as Ireland lost half their side for just 53. Marko Bates and Reuben Wilson arrested the slide for a brief period with a fighting half-century partnership but it only managed to delay the inevitable. From 108/5 to 124 all out, Ireland succumbed real quick to lose the contest by a massive margin of 191 runs.\n\n**Brief scores**:  \n**Afghanistan Under 19s**  315/7 in 50 overs (Faisal Khan 163,

The bill carved out a two-week exemption for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement agencies.\n\nThe bill has yet to be approved by the US House of Representatives, which is out of session.\n\nPresident Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.\n\nIt is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse which lasted 43 days, the longest in US history.\n\nThat shutdown in 2025, which lasted from 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks.\n\nBut this shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday.\n\nThe White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education, and defence to execute shutdown plans.\n\n“Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities,” a White House memo to agencies said. “It is our hope that this lapse will be short.”\n\nPresident Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal.\n\nLawmakers plan to use the fortnight on DHS funds to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents.\n\n“We need to rein in ICE and end the violence,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police.”\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend.\n\nPretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.\n\n**Source: BBC**  \n_\\--Agencies_ \n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

Subsequently, school uniforms and text books were distributed to the students.\n\nPrime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated:\n\nReducing the weight of school bags and creating a pressure-free learning environment so that children come to school with joy is a remarkable feature of these new education reforms. We are committed to turning the ’Dream School’ concept, which is aimed at creating a pleasant school environment into a reality. Further, plans are currently being underway to implement the education reforms that could not be implemented for Grade Six students in 2026 in the future.\n\nUnder the new reforms, building a foundation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), engaging in environment-related activities based on scientific principles, and strengthening the teaching of English and the second language form the core of primary education. For decades, the country followed a competitive education model limited largely to textbook-based knowledge. As this system has contributed to children becoming disengaged from education, the Prime Minister emphasized that it is the Government’s responsibility to ensure every child’s right to education.\n\nThe Government is working to establish a student-centred education system instead of a teacher-centred one. Accordingly, this education reform can be described not merely as a curriculum change, but as a transformational change across the entire education system.\n\nWithin this transformative process, special attention has been given to protecting children’s mental freedom, with the primary objective of nurturing balanced future citizens. Plans have also been developed through these reforms to safeguard the professionalism of teachers and to further enhance their capacities.\n\nWe will never allow a child’s education to be determined by their parents’ financial capacity. We confidently declare that, as a Government, we have undertaken the responsibility of safeguarding your child’s future.\n\nThe event was graced by the presence of members of the Maha Sangha and leaders of all religions, and attended by the Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Education Dr. Madhura Senevirathna, Deputy Minister of Vocational Education Nalin Hewage, Deputy Minister of Mass Media Dr. Kaushalya Ariyarathne, Member of Parliament Asitha Niroshan, Mayor of Kaduwela Ranjan Jayalal, Secretary to the Ministry Nalaka Kaluwewa, Principal of Athurugiriya Gunasekara Primary School Nadika Dharmadasa, along with other officials and parents.\n\n**_\\[Prime Minister’s Media Division\\]_**\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nTeacher unions cry foul over muddled educational reforms](http://island.lk/teacher-unions-cry-foul-over-muddled-educational-reforms/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Stalin questioned the practicality of this approach for rural schools, where access to the internet and digital devices remains limited or non-existent.\n\n“How are children in rural schools expected to access these facilities when internet connectivity and digital devices are either unavailable or very poor?” he asked.\n\nStalin also raised concerns over the absence of a clear long-term vision behind the reforms, stating that even policymakers have failed to clearly articulate the academic or developmental outcomes students are expected to achieve by the time they complete Grade 13.\n\nTeacher preparedness was another major concern, he said, noting that educators assigned to teach under the new system have received training only for the first school term, while key instructional materials remain incomplete.\n\n“Teachers do not even have a proper printed teachers’ guide,” Stalin said, adding that the guide is currently available only online, making it further disadvantageous to schools with weak digital infrastructure.The unions warned that proceeding with the reforms under such conditions could undermine the quality of education and place both teachers and students at a disadvantage.\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/teacher-unions-cry-foul-over-muddled-educational-reforms/)\n\n### [News](http://island.lk/category/news/)\n\nJohnston, two sons and others further remanded for alleged misuse of  Sathosa lorry\n===================================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/946f7b0c2b3df63115fc4971a16037f8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n10 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Thilina Walpola](http://island.lk/author/thilinawalpoladivainagmail-com/ \"Posts by Thilina Walpola\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Johnston-2.jpg)\n\nJohnston\n\nFormer Minister Johnston Fernando, his two sons  and two others were further remanded until 13 February by the Wattala Magistrate’s Court yesterday.The group was arrested by the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) over allegations of misusing a Sathosa lorry during Fernando’s tenure as Minister of Cooperative and Internal Trade.\n\nIt is alleged that the vehicle was used for operations linked to an ethanol company reportedly owned by Fernando, resulting in an estimated loss of Rs. 2.5 million to the state.\n\nFernando was arrested on 05 January. Earlier, on 09 January, a bail request was denied, and the suspects were ordered to remain in remand custody.\n\nThe investigation also led to the 30 December arrest of Fernando’s son, Johan Fernando, in Kurunegala. Former Sathosa Transport Manager Indika Ratnamalala was also taken into custody, accused of preparing forged documents related to the case.\n\n[Continue

The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nMyanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party](http://island.lk/myanmar-election-delivers-walkover-win-for-military-backed-political-party/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nU 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals](http://island.lk/u-19-world-cup-faisal-khans-ton-helps-afghanistan-cruise-into-semifinals/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs.

Thousands have been killed, and about 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.\n\n![YANGON, BURMA - JANUARY 26: Local newspapers feature headlines covering the conclusion of Myanmar's general election on January 26, 2026 in Yangon, Burma.

Faisal hit a belligerent 163 off 142 deliveries after walking out to bat by the end of the third over. He almost batted through the innings and was dismissed only in the 48th over. He was involved in a mammoth partnership with Mahboob Khan who hit 89 off just 79 balls.\n\nEven though Ireland did pick up a few late wickets, the damage was already done as Afghanistan managed to breach 300 and put themselves in a strong position. Abdul Aziz then came out with the ball to put Ireland under more pressure. Having made just 7 runs from the first four overs, Ireland were reduced to 21/3 in the ninth over with Aziz striking twice.\n\nThe wickets continued to tumble as Ireland lost half their side for just 53. Marko Bates and Reuben Wilson arrested the slide for a brief period with a fighting half-century partnership but it only managed to delay the inevitable. From 108/5 to 124 all out, Ireland succumbed real quick to lose the contest by a massive margin of 191 runs.\n\n**Brief scores**:  \n**Afghanistan Under 19s**  315/7 in 50 overs (Faisal Khan 163,

The site, where locals dig manually for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the AFC/M23 rebel group since 2024.\n\nThe collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.\n\n“More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” Muyisa said, adding that about 20 injured people were being treated in health facilities.\n\n“We are in the rainy season. The ground is fragile. It was the ground that gave way while the victims were in the hole.”\n\nAn adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.\n\nThe United Nations says AFC/M23 has plundered Rubaya’s riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.\n\nThe heavily-armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a lightning advance last year.\n\n**Source: Reuters**\n\n_\\--Agencies_\n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.\n\nThough the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.\n\nAt its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.\n\nGuterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was “categorically different”.\n\n“Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,” the secretary general said, without naming specific members.\n\nHe said the “integrity of the entire system” depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their “assessed contributions” - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.\n\nGuterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a “double blow” in which it was “expected to give back cash that does not exist”.\n\n“I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.”\n\nAs a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had.\n\nThe letter reads: “Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m \\[£165m\\] – funds we have not collected.”\n\n“The bottom line is clear,” Guterres wrote. “Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.”\n\nUN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult.\n\nThe US is the UN’s largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its “great potential” and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.\n\nThe US did not pay its contribution to the UN’s regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.\n\nThen in January, Trump withdrew it from dozens of international organisations, including 31 UN agencies, to “end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities”.\n\nIn late December, the US pledged $2bn (£1.5bn) in funding for UN humanitarian programmes - warning the international organisation must “adapt or die” - a fraction of the $17bn it spent in 2022.\n\nOther countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN’s work.\n\nGuterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a “race to bankruptcy”.\n\nTrump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.\n\nThe US president has said its work would happen “in conjunction with the United Nations” - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN’s place, he replied: “Well, it might.”\n\nThe US officially left the UN’s World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.\n\nOther agencies are also making huge cuts.\n\nThe UN’s human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.\n\n**Source: BBC**  \n_\\--Agencies_ \n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” Muyisa told Reuters, adding that about 20 injured people were being treated in health facilities.\n\n“We are in the rainy season. The ground is fragile. It was the ground that gave way while the victims were in the hole,” he said.\n\nEraston Bahati Musanga, the governor of North Kivu province appointed by the M23 rebel group, told the AFP news agency on Friday that “some bodies have been recovered”, without giving a specific figure of the number of those killed and injured, but suggesting a potentially high death toll.\n\nAn adviser to the provincial governor put the death toll at more than 200, speaking on condition of anonymity to Reuters because he was not authorised to brief the media.\n\nAFP said it was unable to confirm the death toll with independent sources as of Friday evening.\n\nFranck Bolingo, an artisanal miner interviewed at Rubaya by AFP, said people are believed to still be trapped inside the mine.\n\n“It rained, then the landslide happened and swept people away. Some were buried alive, and others are still trapped in the shafts,” Bolingo said.\n\nRubaya produces about 15 percent of the world’s coltan, which is processed into tantalum, a heat-resistant metal that is in high demand by makers of mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines.\n\nThe mine, where [locals dig manually](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/5/19/dr-congos-coltan-miners-struggle-as-they-dig-to-feed-worlds-tech)\n for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the [Rwanda-backed M23](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/24/drc-m23-rebels-commit-to-pause-fighting-amid-peace-talks)\n rebel group since 2024, after previously changing hands between the DRC government and rebel groups.\n\nThe heavily-armed M23 rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the DRC government in the capital Kinshasa, captured even more mineral-rich territory in the east of the country during a lightning advance last year.\n\nThe United Nations has accused M23 rebels of plundering Rubaya’s resources to help fund their rebellion, backed by Rwanda, an allegation that the government in Kigali denies.\n\nDespite the DRC’s exceptional mineral wealth, more than 70 percent of Congolese live on less than $2.15 a day.

That means you can earn more than 120% annually. Therefore, people should realize that if such a profit can be made from an investment, they could do it themselves.”\n\n“There is no need to give your money to someone else to do it. However, we all know that this is practically impossible to achieve.”\n\nWeerasinghe said the Central Bank has observed an increasing trend of the public being lured toward fraudulent investment schemes in plantations and agriculture sectors.\n\n“The first thing to remember is that plantation investments are unregulated.

Jegajeevan, Director of the Central Bank’s Economic Research Department told reporters on Wednesday (28).\n\nShe did not explain the reason for the slow down, but analysts attribute the slowdown to lower economic activities in December after the disaster late in November.\n\nJegajeevan said improving demand conditions as well as notable increase in vehicle imports led to strong private credit demand in the second half of 2025 with a slowdown in December.

It is the latest concession Rodríguez has made since taking the reins of the country on Jan. 3 after the brazen seizure of then-President Nicolás Maduro in a U.S. military attack in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas.\n\nRodríguez told a gathering of justices, magistrates and others that the ruling party-controlled National Assembly would take up the bill with urgency.\n\n“May this law serve to heal the wounds left by the political confrontation,” she added during the televised event.\n\nRodríguez also announced the shutdown of Helicoide, a prison in Caracas where torture and other human rights abuses have been repeatedly documented by independent organizations. The facility, she said, will be transformed into a sports, social and cultural center for police and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nThe Venezuelan-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal estimates that 711 people are in detention facilities across the South American country for their political activities.\n\nThe government did not release the text of the bill on Friday, leaving unclear the specific criteria that will be used to determine who qualifies for amnesty.\n\nRodríguez said the “general amnesty law” will cover the “entire period of political violence from 1999 to the present.” She also explained that people convicted of murder, drug trafficking, corruption or human rights violations will not qualify for relief.\n\nRodríguez’s government earlier this month had announced plans to release a significant number of prisoners in a goodwill gesture, but relatives of those detained have condemned the slow pace of the releases.\n\n“A general amnesty is welcome as long as its elements and conditions include all of civil society, without discrimination, that it does not become a cloak of impunity, and that it contributes to dismantling the repressive apparatus of political persecution,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on social media.\n\nThe organization has tallied 302 releases since Jan. 8, when National Assembly president Jorge Rodríguez announced that the government would free a significant number of prisoners.\n\nThe human rights group Provea in a statement called out the lack of transparency and “trickle” pace of prisoner releases over the past few weeks and underscored that while the freeing of those still detained “is urgent, the announcement of an amnesty should not be conceived, under any circumstances, as a pardon or act of clemency on the part of the State.”\n\n“We recall that these people were arbitrarily imprisoned for exercising rights protected by international human rights instruments, the National Constitution, and Venezuelan laws,” the organization said.\n\n**Source: AP**\n\n_\\--Agencies_\n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

Faisal hit a belligerent 163 off 142 deliveries after walking out to bat by the end of the third over. He almost batted through the innings and was dismissed only in the 48th over. He was involved in a mammoth partnership with Mahboob Khan who hit 89 off just 79 balls.\n\nEven though Ireland did pick up a few late wickets, the damage was already done as Afghanistan managed to breach 300 and put themselves in a strong position. Abdul Aziz then came out with the ball to put Ireland under more pressure. Having made just 7 runs from the first four overs, Ireland were reduced to 21/3 in the ninth over with Aziz striking twice.\n\nThe wickets continued to tumble as Ireland lost half their side for just 53. Marko Bates and Reuben Wilson arrested the slide for a brief period with a fighting half-century partnership but it only managed to delay the inevitable. From 108/5 to 124 all out, Ireland succumbed real quick to lose the contest by a massive margin of 191 runs.\n\n**Brief scores**:  \n**Afghanistan Under 19s**  315/7 in 50 overs (Faisal Khan 163, Mahboob Khan 89; Reuben Wilson 3/52) beat **Ireland Under 19s**  124 in 40.4 overs (Marko Bates 34; Abdul Aziz 3/21) _**by 191 runs**_\n\n\\[Cricbuzz\\]\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nICC and World Cricketers Association clash over player terms ahead of T20 World Cup](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nU19 World Cup: England qualify for semifinals](http://island.lk/u19-world-cup-england-qualify-for-semifinals/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/u-19-world-cup-faisal-khans-ton-helps-afghanistan-cruise-into-semifinals/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs. But GG clawed back, with Gayakwad getting Amanjot Kaur stumped and Wareham trapping Sanskriti Gupta for a first-ball duck. Harmanpreet ended the night with the Orange Cap on her head, but it was the team in orange that progressed to the next round.\n\nBrief scores:  \n**Gujarat Giants Women** 167 for 4 in 20 overs (Sophie Devine 25, Anushka Sharma 33, Ashleigh Gardner 46, Georgia Wareham 44\\*; Shabnim Ismail 1-29, Nat Sciver Brunt 1-36, Amelia  Kerr 2-26) _beat_ **Mumbai Indians Women**  156 for 7 in 20 overs  (Sajeevan Sajana 26, Harmanpreet Kaur 82\\*, Amelia Kerr 20, Amanjot Kaur 13; Kashvee Gautam  1-12, Rajeshwari Gayakwad  1-46, Sophie Devine 2-23, Georgia Wareham 2-26, Ashleigh Gardner 1-26) _**by 11 runs**_\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nMyanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party\n==========================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n4 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar.png)\n\nMyanmar nationalists wave the national flag in downtown Yangon, Myanmar, on January 27, 2026 \\[Aljazeera\\]\n\nMyanmar’s military-backed party secured a sweeping victory in the country’s three-phase general election, according to state media, following the tightly controlled voting held amid civil war and widespread repression.\n\nThe final of three rounds of voting last weekend wrapped up an election that began on December 28, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nDominating all phases of the vote, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won an overwhelming majority in Myanmar’s two legislative chambers, state media reports.\n\nThe USDP secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.\n\nA spokesman for the country’s military rulers, Zaw Min Tun, said Myanmar’s parliament is now expected to convene to elect a president in March, with a new government set to take over in April, according to a report in the pro-military Eleven Media Group.\n\nMyanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been in political turmoil since the 2021 coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests prompting a nationwide rebellion. Thousands have been killed, and about 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.\n\n![YANGON, BURMA - JANUARY 26: Local newspapers feature headlines covering the conclusion of Myanmar's general election on January 26, 2026 in Yangon, Burma.

The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n*

On a surface that wasn’t easier for batting, England adapted, and posted a competitive 234 before defending it with ease to win by 65 runs.\n\nDespite not getting off to a flier, England’s openers gave their side a solid platform with a 48-run stand. After Joseph Moores departed for 20, Ben Dawkins and Ben Mayes carried on to set up another fruitful partnership. But New Zealand fought back with regular strikes in the second half of the innings and ensured there was no momentum for the batting side. Mayes hit a half-century and Caleb Falconer hit a crucial 47 but it was Farhan Ahmed’s cameo of 29\\* off just 23 balls that eventually pushed the scoring rate right at the end.\n\nIn reply, New Zealand made a poor start in pursuit of 235. Manny Lumsden picked two wickets in an over and there was also a needless run out that reduced New Zealand to 64/4. Snehith Reddy, who had bagged a couple of wickets with the ball, tried to resurrect the chase with a fighting 47 but once he departed, the job became a lot easier for the English bowling attack. Lumsden put an end to New Zealand’s struggles in the 39th over with wickets off successive deliveries to finish with a five-fer.\n\n**Brief scores**:  \n**England  Under 19s**  234/7 in 50 overs (Ben Mayes 53, Caleb Falconer 47; Snehith Reddy 2/28) beat **New Zealand Under 19s**  169  in 38.5 overs (Snehith Reddy 47; Manny Lumsden 5/17) _**by 65 runs**_\n\n**_\\[Cricbuzz\\]_**\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nU 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals](http://island.lk/u-19-world-cup-faisal-khans-ton-helps-afghanistan-cruise-into-semifinals/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nCurran hat-trick caps England win in rain-shortened series opener](http://island.lk/curran-hat-trick-caps-england-win-in-rain-shortened-series-opener/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/u19-world-cup-england-qualify-for-semifinals/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs. But GG clawed back, with Gayakwad getting Amanjot Kaur stumped and Wareham trapping Sanskriti Gupta for a first-ball duck. Harmanpreet ended the night with the Orange Cap on her head, but it was the team in orange that progressed to the next round.\n\nBrief scores:  \n**Gujarat Giants Women** 167 for 4 in 20 overs (Sophie Devine 25, Anushka Sharma 33, Ashleigh Gardner 46, Georgia Wareham 44\\*; Shabnim Ismail 1-29, Nat Sciver Brunt 1-36, Amelia  Kerr 2-26) _beat_ **Mumbai Indians Women**  156 for 7 in 20 overs  (Sajeevan Sajana 26, Harmanpreet Kaur 82\\*, Amelia Kerr 20, Amanjot Kaur 13; Kashvee Gautam  1-12, Rajeshwari Gayakwad  1-46, Sophie Devine 2-23, Georgia Wareham 2-26, Ashleigh Gardner 1-26) _**by 11 runs**_\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nMyanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party\n==========================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n4 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar.png)\n\nMyanmar nationalists wave the national flag in downtown Yangon, Myanmar, on January 27, 2026 \\[Aljazeera\\]\n\nMyanmar’s military-backed party secured a sweeping victory in the country’s three-phase general election, according to state media, following the tightly controlled voting held amid civil war and widespread repression.\n\nThe final of three rounds of voting last weekend wrapped up an election that began on December 28, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nDominating all phases of the vote, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won an overwhelming majority in Myanmar’s two legislative chambers, state media reports.\n\nThe USDP secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.\n\nA spokesman for the country’s military rulers, Zaw Min Tun, said Myanmar’s parliament is now expected to convene to elect a president in March, with a new government set to take over in April, according to a report in the pro-military Eleven Media Group.\n\nMyanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been in political turmoil since the 2021 coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests prompting a nationwide rebellion.

The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n*

And, with the ground already covered with the groundstaff’s trademark blue tarpaulins, the match was called off, with England 11 runs ahead of a DLS-adjusted target of 114.\n\nEngland had chosen to bowl first after the initial delay but were soon chasing leather, as Sri Lanka romped along to 75 for 1 in a high-octane first seven overs. However, Rashid and his experienced spin sidekick, Liam Dawson, instigated a dramatic collapse with five wickets in as many overs, setting the stage for Curran’s show-stealing display, as the hosts lost nine for 57 in 56 balls.\n\nEngland’s reply was not without its dramas, as Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell were both prised out in the powerplay by Eshan Malinga, before Phil Salt was badly dropped by Kamil Mishara at deep midwicket off Wanindu Hasaranga’s first delivery. And though he did not get the rewards, nor possess the surname of Sri Lanka’s chief wicket-taker, Matheesha Pathirana was a persistent menace with his Lasith Malinga-style 90mph slingers.\n\nHowever, Tom Banton – picked at No.4 in the absence of the injured Ben Duckett – provided the chase with true impetus, with a lively knock of 29 from 14. Salt then took charge with a composed 46 from 35 balls, eventually falling just shy of his fifth T20I half-century in eight innings. Despite all their angst across formats this winter, in T20I cricket specifically England are hitting an impressive vein of form.\n\nCurran knows all about bouncing back in style after a tough knock-back. This time last year, he feared his “face didn’t fit” after Brendon McCullum had cut him from England’s white-ball plans in favour of a churn of 90mph options. Now, the star of their 2022 T20 World Cup triumph is back as a lock for their 2026 campaign, after claiming England’s first T20I hat-trick since Chris Jordan against the USA at Bridgetown in the 2024 tournament.\n\nIt wasn’t initially much of a night to remember for Curran, however. His first two overs were belted for 35 runs, with Kusal Mendis taking a particular liking to his medium-paced allsorts – Kusal’s two sixes in three balls came either side of Curran’s new trademark “moonball”, which plops out of the night sky at 53mph/85kph (as if it were a direct rebuke to McCullum’s predilections). In fact, he landed that variation so well first time around that he tried it again immediately… and got tonked over the sightscreen for his sins.\n\nCurran’s third over, however, was rather different gravy. Sri Lanka’s innings was, by now, in tatters courtesy of England’s spinners, but all hope of a recovery ended when Dasun Shanaka slapped a drive to Harry Brook at mid-off for 20. Maheesh Theekshana then came and went with a wild hoick across the full length, to Jamie Overton at long-on, and with the ground rapt with expectation, Pathirana had no answer to the full, straight delivery that spread-eagled his stumps for Curran’s third career hat-trick across T20 formats.\n\nAt 75 for 1 after seven overs, Sri Lanka had seemed on course for a monster total. A clue to their incoming struggles, however, had already been glimpsed in England’s initial spin forays. Though Dawson’s first over went for 14 runs, that included a bizarre first delivery to Pathum Nissanka that deflected off his leg stump for four byes without dislodging the zing bail, while Rashid’s five singles and a dot were an obvious sign of things to come.\n\nSure enough, Rashid did for Nissanka in his second over, via a top-edged slog for 23 off 20, and thereafter, the spinners operated as a tag-team between overs eight and 12.\n\nDawson got his rewards with the scalp of Charith Asalanka, well caught at deep midwicket by Jacob Bethell for 2. Rashid then made it three wickets in as many overs when Kusal’s lively knock ended with a tame lob to long-on from 37 off 20. Back came Dawson with a quicker ball and a successfully reviewed appeal – his lbw appeal against Pavan Liyanage was so plumb that umpire Ravi Wimalasiri assumed there had to have been an inside-edge. And, after Rashid had induced Dhananjaya de Silva into another top-edged slog-sweep, to cap his ageless figures of 3 for 19 in four overs, Sri Lanka had crumbled to 100 for 6. From there, Curran would offer no let-up.\n\nArcher’s rapid return to action has been the surprise development of this tour. He missed the final two Ashes Tests with a side strain, which can be notoriously tough for fast bowlers to shake off, but having been re-added to the squad ahead of schedule, he showed no ill-effects in a hugely encouraging first outing of the year.\n\nCruising to the crease with his pace touching 91mph on occasions, Archer so nearly struck in his first over as Dawson dropped a flying chance at short midwicket, and had conceded just two runs in eight balls before Nissanka and Mishara connected with a brace of off-side boundaries in his second over. A lusty launch for six from Shanaka would be the only other real dent to his figures.\n\nIt was perhaps surprising that England chose to risk Archer in such conditions. The outfield was still pretty slick after steady rain for much of the day in Pallekele – a rope continued to be dragged across the surface at intervals during the match – and they’d opted against his inclusion in another rain-shortened shoot-out in Cardiff last September. However, the desire to get him back up to match fitness was over-riding, and on this occasion, justified.\n\nWith all the attention elsewhere, the pick of England’s quicks was arguably Overton. Though Mishara swiped his first delivery over long-on for six, his heavy lengths proved hard to combat on this surface, and he topped and tailed the innings with 2 for 17 in 2.2 overs. Mishara was his first (via the first of many top-edged wipes, this time to midwicket) before Hasaranga lost his leg stump to sink Sri Lanka’s innings with four balls of their 17 overs left unused.\n\nBrief scores:  \n**England** 125 for 4 in 16 overs (Phil Salt 46, Jos Buttler 17, Tom Banton 29, Harry Brook 16\\*; Matheesha Pathirana 1-18, Eshan Malinga 2-24, Dasun Shanaka 1-12) _beat_ **Sri Lanka** 133 in 18.2 overs  (Pathum Nissanka 23, Kamil Mishara 16, Kusal Mendis  37,Dhananjaya de Silva 11, Dasun Shanaka 20, Wanidu Hasaranga 14;  Adil Rashid 3-19, Sam Curran 3-38, Jamie Overton 2-17, Liam Dawson 2-31) **_by 11 runs – DLS_**\n\n**\\[Cricinfo\\]**\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nU19 World Cup: England qualify for semifinals](http://island.lk/u19-world-cup-england-qualify-for-semifinals/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nUSA pick former SL allrounder Shehan Jayasuriya in T20 World Cup squad](http://island.lk/usa-pick-former-sl-allrounder-shehan-jayasuriya-in-t20-world-cup-squad/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/curran-hat-trick-caps-england-win-in-rain-shortened-series-opener/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

On a day when they became the first team in 41 WPL games to bat after winning the toss, they went on to reserve another trend – of not having beatenMumbai Indians (MI) in eight previous meetings. With their fifth win of WPL 2026, all of which have come while defending totals, GG qualified for the Eliminator for a second season in a row.\n\nIt did not come easy. Harmanpreet Kaur threatened to do what she did to GG in 2024 with a playoffs spot on the line. With MI needing 58 off 24 balls, she all but single-handedly brought them within reach of victory, hitting three fours and three sixes – twice clearing the rope off Ashleigh Gardner in the final over – to bring the equation down to 14 off 3. But Gardner kept her calm and closed out the over to seal GG’s first-ever win over the two-time champions.\n\nIt was a fitting end, because Gardner had been a catalyst in GG’s strong finish earlier in the evening. She scored 46 off 28 balls, and added 71 off 43 with Georgia Wareham to take GG to 167, a total that had looked distant for much of their innings.\n\nIt is not yet curtains for MI, though. They will now hope for a UP Warriorz win over Delhi Capitals in the last league fixture on Sunday, with net run rate coming into play.\n\nWhile GG seemed to back a method that has worked for them this season, their toss decision was fraught with risk, especially after Beth Mooney fell cheaply. Sophie Devine and Anushka Sharma looked solid but couldn’t really force the pace until the final over of the powerplay, in which they scored 12 off Vaishnavi Sharma. Despite not picking up wickets regularly, MI had the innings under control: GG scored in double-digits in only two of the first 11 overs. When Devine and Anushka fell in successive overs, GG had to rebuild with only 45% of their overs left.\n\nGardner and Wareham hit at least one four in each of the first three overs of their partnership. The switch was truly flicked when Wareham danced down to Amelia Kerr and launched her over the sightscreen in the 15th over. Gardner then hit Hayley Matthews for 6, 4, 4, 4 in the 16th, and both batters hit two fours each in the 17th, Shabnim Ismail’s final over. Gardner was soon stumped off Kerr but Wareham kept the big hits coming, finishing on 44 not out off 26 as GG scored 61 in their last five overs.\n\nWith GG going spin-heavy, Harmanpreet began finding the boundary regularly. She particularly targeted the shorter leg-side boundary (51m vs 59m) against Rajeshwari Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, hitting her for two sixes and a four in the space of seven balls spread across two overs. But GG clawed back, with Gayakwad getting Amanjot Kaur stumped and Wareham trapping Sanskriti Gupta for a first-ball duck. Harmanpreet ended the night with the Orange Cap on her head, but it was the team in orange that progressed to the next round.\n\nBrief scores:  \n**Gujarat Giants Women** 167 for 4 in 20 overs (Sophie Devine 25, Anushka Sharma 33, Ashleigh Gardner 46, Georgia Wareham 44\\*; Shabnim Ismail 1-29, Nat Sciver Brunt 1-36, Amelia  Kerr 2-26) _beat_ **Mumbai Indians Women**  156 for 7 in 20 overs  (Sajeevan Sajana 26, Harmanpreet Kaur 82\\*, Amelia Kerr 20, Amanjot Kaur 13; Kashvee Gautam  1-12, Rajeshwari Gayakwad  1-46, Sophie Devine 2-23, Georgia Wareham 2-26, Ashleigh Gardner 1-26) _**by 11 runs**_\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n\n### [Latest News](http://island.lk/category/latest-news/)\n\nMyanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party\n==========================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/358aaf046c3a304a8fbdbf379547c8a8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n4 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Priyan](http://island.lk/author/priyan/ \"Posts by Priyan\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar.png)\n\nMyanmar nationalists wave the national flag in downtown Yangon, Myanmar, on January 27, 2026 \\[Aljazeera\\]\n\nMyanmar’s military-backed party secured a sweeping victory in the country’s three-phase general election, according to state media, following the tightly controlled voting held amid civil war and widespread repression.\n\nThe final of three rounds of voting last weekend wrapped up an election that began on December 28, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nDominating all phases of the vote, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won an overwhelming majority in Myanmar’s two legislative chambers, state media reports.\n\nThe USDP secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.\n\nA spokesman for the country’s military rulers, Zaw Min Tun, said Myanmar’s parliament is now expected to convene to elect a president in March, with a new government set to take over in April, according to a report in the pro-military Eleven Media Group.\n\nMyanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been in political turmoil since the 2021 coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests prompting a nationwide rebellion. Thousands have been killed, and about 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.\n\n![YANGON, BURMA - JANUARY 26: Local newspapers feature headlines covering the conclusion of Myanmar's general election on January 26, 2026 in Yangon, Burma. Myanmar concluded its multi-phase general election on January 25, 2026, after voting began on December 28, 2025, under the military administration that took power in the 2021 coup and has overseen the country amid ongoing conflict.

The WCA claims the new, non-agreed version is exploitative when compared to the 2024 version.\n\nWCA had written to the ICC about these concerns and ESPNcricinfo understands the ICC, in its response, disagreed, saying the 2024 agreement was only applicable to eight member boards (referred to as National Governing Boards, or NGBs). The ICC told WCA that the remaining members who are part of this World Cup were not bound by the 2024 agreement.\n\nThe eight NGBs are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland – in as a replacement for Bangladesh, who have been excluded after they refused to travel to India. Of the remaining 12 participating countries, boards from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the UAE do not recognise WCA and hence their players are not affiliated with it. Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, USA and Canada have player bodies but had not received the squad terms as of January 15, and were expected to get the non-approved version, the WCA said in a memo.\n\nIn its follow-up response, WCA told the ICC that the 2024 agreement stated it was applicable to all players affiliated with the players body – both that were participating in the World Cup and from countries that were not part of the 20-team tournament. As a result, WCA noted, all players should be protected by the 2024 agreement, which it believes is legally binding.\n\nWCA sent a memo on January 15 informing players that the squad terms distributed by ICC were “substantially different” to the agreed 2024 version. It is understood WCA also sent an email to ICC on the same day.\n\nTom Moffat, the WCA CEO, highlighted differences across eight areas between the two versions: content/media appearances, behind the scenes content, changing room access, biological player related data, licensing, name, image likeness (NIL), player agreement and dispute resolution.\n\nThe WCA’s broader contention was that the 2024 agreement gave players the right to decide, and negotiate via the global players body, whereas the ICC version says player consent is not needed, with their boards having that authority.\n\nAn example of the significant differences is NIL rights, according to the communication Moffat sent to players. In the ICC’s new version, “the player is required to license their NIL to any third party; 3 players from the same team can be used by an ICC Partner for commercial content which can directly relate to the promotion of the Partners brand or product; the player’s national board approves all use of NIL on behalf of the player; Any use of NIL outside of the Squad Terms can be agreed by the player’s national board.”\n\nIn the 2024 agreement, the NIL rights were “restricted” only to the ICC’s commercial partners and the event hosts and the WCA is authorised on behalf of the players to negotiate terms and use. The 2024 version also said a group of players – not three per team – would be “represented in all content” promoting the ICC tournament.\n\nThere are significant differences in the terms for the usage of player data during the event as well. The WCA said in the ICC version, the governing body “can use and commercialise player data with the agreement of the player’s national board” and that the ICC “owns” the data. The approved version, WCA said, says the player owns the data and their consent is necessary “given the sensitivities.”\n\nIn the ICC version, once the players participate in a global tournament, “he /she is deemed to have accepted the Squad Terms regardless of whether they sign the Terms.” In the version agreed between the WCA and ICC, the players are required to agree the terms and sign for every event separately.\n\nIn the memo to players, Moffat accused the ICC and member boards of “deliberately removing” all the protection that players were assured of in the 2024 terms, while “attempting” to “own” players and “claim an almost unlimited ability to use and commercialise it with third parties without your consent, with the only recourse to an in-house dispute resolution process run by the ICC itself .” Moffat also said the ICC and member boards were trying to “exploit the most vulnerable, and worst paid player groups at this World Cup, some of whom are amateur,” through the non-approved version.\n\nThis week, Moffat told ESPNcricinfo that the WCA did not want to disrupt the World Cup, but admitted being “deeply concerned” by ICC presenting terms that did not “align” with the 2024 agreement. “The (ICC) terms provided significantly erode player rights and protections including around image and commercial use, compared to those agreed,” Moffat said. “It is especially concerning that it is the most vulnerable playing groups who appear to have been targeted and expected to compete under different terms and conditions to other playing groups participating in the same Men’s T20 World Cup. For many players affected, participation in ICC Events represents a primary source of income and career progression.\n\n“The WCA supports the growth of the game and ICC events, but these objectives should be pursued in partnership with players, not at their expense. The agreed Squad Terms have now been signed by impacted WCA players, and our expectation is for these terms to be honoured by the ICC for the T20 World Cup.”\n\nIt is understood the ICC has not responded to WCA’s follow-up mail sent earlier this week. The ICC has been asked for a comment.\n\n**_\\[Cricinfo\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n\n*

Stalin questioned the practicality of this approach for rural schools, where access to the internet and digital devices remains limited or non-existent.\n\n“How are children in rural schools expected to access these facilities when internet connectivity and digital devices are either unavailable or very poor?” he asked.\n\nStalin also raised concerns over the absence of a clear long-term vision behind the reforms, stating that even policymakers have failed to clearly articulate the academic or developmental outcomes students are expected to achieve by the time they complete Grade 13.\n\nTeacher preparedness was another major concern, he said, noting that educators assigned to teach under the new system have received training only for the first school term, while key instructional materials remain incomplete.\n\n“Teachers do not even have a proper printed teachers’ guide,” Stalin said, adding that the guide is currently available only online, making it further disadvantageous to schools with weak digital infrastructure.The unions warned that proceeding with the reforms under such conditions could undermine the quality of education and place both teachers and students at a disadvantage.\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:[Featured](http://island.lk/tag/featured/)\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nNew education reforms for grade one officially launched](http://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nJohnston, two sons and others further remanded for alleged misuse of  Sathosa lorry](http://island.lk/johnston-two-sons-and-others-further-remanded-for-alleged-misuse-of-sathosa-lorry/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ashleigh-1000x600.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ashleigh-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    Harmanpreet 82\\* in vain as Gujarat Giants break Mumbai Indians hoodoo and seal Eliminator spot](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    Myanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party](http://island.lk/myanmar-election-delivers-walkover-win-for-military-backed-political-party/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PM-1-2026-01-29-at-23.55.11-1000x600.jpeg) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PM-1-2026-01-29-at-23.55.11-150x150.jpeg)\\\n    \\\n    New education reforms for grade one officially launched](http://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tom-Moffart-1000x600.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tom-Moffart-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    ICC and World Cricketers Association clash over player terms ahead of T20 World Cup](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    U 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals](http://island.lk/u-19-world-cup-faisal-khans-ton-helps-afghanistan-cruise-into-semifinals/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/England-under-19-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/England-under-19-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    U19 World Cup: England qualify for semifinals](http://island.lk/u19-world-cup-england-qualify-for-semifinals/)\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/teacher-unions-cry-foul-over-muddled-educational-reforms/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Subsequently, school uniforms and text books were distributed to the students.\n\nPrime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated:\n\nReducing the weight of school bags and creating a pressure-free learning environment so that children come to school with joy is a remarkable feature of these new education reforms. We are committed to turning the ’Dream School’ concept, which is aimed at creating a pleasant school environment into a reality. Further, plans are currently being underway to implement the education reforms that could not be implemented for Grade Six students in 2026 in the future.\n\nUnder the new reforms, building a foundation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), engaging in environment-related activities based on scientific principles, and strengthening the teaching of English and the second language form the core of primary education. For decades, the country followed a competitive education model limited largely to textbook-based knowledge. As this system has contributed to children becoming disengaged from education, the Prime Minister emphasized that it is the Government’s responsibility to ensure every child’s right to education.\n\nThe Government is working to establish a student-centred education system instead of a teacher-centred one. Accordingly, this education reform can be described not merely as a curriculum change, but as a transformational change across the entire education system.\n\nWithin this transformative process, special attention has been given to protecting children’s mental freedom, with the primary objective of nurturing balanced future citizens. Plans have also been developed through these reforms to safeguard the professionalism of teachers and to further enhance their capacities.\n\nWe will never allow a child’s education to be determined by their parents’ financial capacity. We confidently declare that, as a Government, we have undertaken the responsibility of safeguarding your child’s future.\n\nThe event was graced by the presence of members of the Maha Sangha and leaders of all religions, and attended by the Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Education Dr. Madhura Senevirathna, Deputy Minister of Vocational Education Nalin Hewage, Deputy Minister of Mass Media Dr. Kaushalya Ariyarathne, Member of Parliament Asitha Niroshan, Mayor of Kaduwela Ranjan Jayalal, Secretary to the Ministry Nalaka Kaluwewa, Principal of Athurugiriya Gunasekara Primary School Nadika Dharmadasa, along with other officials and parents.\n\n**_\\[Prime Minister’s Media Division\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/)\n\n### [News](http://island.lk/category/news/)\n\nJohnston, two sons and others further remanded for alleged misuse of  Sathosa lorry\n===================================================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/946f7b0c2b3df63115fc4971a16037f8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n10 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Thilina Walpola](http://island.lk/author/thilinawalpoladivainagmail-com/ \"Posts by Thilina Walpola\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Johnston-2.jpg)\n\nJohnston\n\nFormer Minister Johnston Fernando, his two sons  and two others were further remanded until 13 February by the Wattala Magistrate’s Court yesterday.The group was arrested by the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) over allegations of misusing a Sathosa lorry during Fernando’s tenure as Minister of Cooperative and Internal Trade.\n\nIt is alleged that the vehicle was used for operations linked to an ethanol company reportedly owned by Fernando, resulting in an estimated loss of Rs. 2.5 million to the state.\n\nFernando was arrested on 05 January. Earlier, on 09 January, a bail request was denied, and the suspects were ordered to remain in remand custody.\n\nThe investigation also led to the 30 December arrest of Fernando’s son, Johan Fernando, in Kurunegala. Former Sathosa Transport Manager Indika Ratnamalala was also taken into custody, accused of preparing forged documents related to the case.\n\n[Continue

Earlier, on 09 January, a bail request was denied, and the suspects were ordered to remain in remand custody.\n\nThe investigation also led to the 30 December arrest of Fernando’s son, Johan Fernando, in Kurunegala. Former Sathosa Transport Manager Indika Ratnamalala was also taken into custody, accused of preparing forged documents related to the case.\n\n* * *\n\n*   [All News Advertisement](http://island.lk/kapruka-advertiesment/)\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nRelated Topics:[Featured](http://island.lk/tag/featured/)\n\n[Up Next\\\n\\\nTeacher unions cry foul over muddled educational reforms](http://island.lk/teacher-unions-cry-foul-over-muddled-educational-reforms/)\n\n[Don't Miss\\\n\\\nIGP complains of 32,000 personnel shortage](http://island.lk/igp-complains-of-32000-personnel-shortage/)\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/island-logo-lg-new.jpg)\n\nContinue Reading\n\n#### You may like\n\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ashleigh-1000x600.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ashleigh-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    Harmanpreet 82\\* in vain as Gujarat Giants break Mumbai Indians hoodoo and seal Eliminator spot](http://island.lk/harmanpreet-82-in-vain-as-gujarat-giants-break-mumbai-indians-hoodoo-and-seal-eliminator-spot/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Myanmar-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    Myanmar election delivers walkover win for military-backed political party](http://island.lk/myanmar-election-delivers-walkover-win-for-military-backed-political-party/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PM-1-2026-01-29-at-23.55.11-1000x600.jpeg) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PM-1-2026-01-29-at-23.55.11-150x150.jpeg)\\\n    \\\n    New education reforms for grade one officially launched](http://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tom-Moffart-1000x600.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tom-Moffart-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    ICC and World Cricketers Association clash over player terms ahead of T20 World Cup](http://island.lk/icc-and-world-cricketers-association-clash-over-player-terms-ahead-of-t20-world-cup/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Faisal-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    U 19 World Cup: Faisal Khan’s ton helps Afghanistan cruise into semifinals](http://island.lk/u-19-world-cup-faisal-khans-ton-helps-afghanistan-cruise-into-semifinals/)\n [*   ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/England-under-19-590x354.png) ![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/England-under-19-150x150.png)\\\n    \\\n    U19 World Cup: England qualify for semifinals](http://island.lk/u19-world-cup-england-qualify-for-semifinals/)\n\nClick to comment\n\n#### Leave a Reply\n\n[Cancel reply](https://island.lk/johnston-two-sons-and-others-further-remanded-for-alleged-misuse-of-sathosa-lorry/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Subsequently, school uniforms and text books were distributed to the students.\n\nPrime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated:\n\nReducing the weight of school bags and creating a pressure-free learning environment so that children come to school with joy is a remarkable feature of these new education reforms. We are committed to turning the ’Dream School’ concept, which is aimed at creating a pleasant school environment into a reality. Further, plans are currently being underway to implement the education reforms that could not be implemented for Grade Six students in 2026 in the future.\n\nUnder the new reforms, building a foundation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), engaging in environment-related activities based on scientific principles, and strengthening the teaching of English and the second language form the core of primary education. For decades, the country followed a competitive education model limited largely to textbook-based knowledge. As this system has contributed to children becoming disengaged from education, the Prime Minister emphasized that it is the Government’s responsibility to ensure every child’s right to education.\n\nThe Government is working to establish a student-centred education system instead of a teacher-centred one. Accordingly, this education reform can be described not merely as a curriculum change, but as a transformational change across the entire education system.\n\nWithin this transformative process, special attention has been given to protecting children’s mental freedom, with the primary objective of nurturing balanced future citizens. Plans have also been developed through these reforms to safeguard the professionalism of teachers and to further enhance their capacities.\n\nWe will never allow a child’s education to be determined by their parents’ financial capacity. We confidently declare that, as a Government, we have undertaken the responsibility of safeguarding your child’s future.\n\nThe event was graced by the presence of members of the Maha Sangha and leaders of all religions, and attended by the Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Education Dr. Madhura Senevirathna, Deputy Minister of Vocational Education Nalin Hewage, Deputy Minister of Mass Media Dr. Kaushalya Ariyarathne, Member of Parliament Asitha Niroshan, Mayor of Kaduwela Ranjan Jayalal, Secretary to the Ministry Nalaka Kaluwewa, Principal of Athurugiriya Gunasekara Primary School Nadika Dharmadasa, along with other officials and parents.\n\n**_\\[Prime Minister’s Media Division\\]_**\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/new-education-reforms-for-grade-one-officially-launched/)\n\n### [News](http://island.lk/category/news/)\n\nTeacher unions cry foul over muddled educational reforms\n========================================================\n\n![](http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/946f7b0c2b3df63115fc4971a16037f8?s=92&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPublished\n\n10 hours ago\n\non\n\n2026/01/31\n\nBy\n\n[Thilina Walpola](http://island.lk/author/thilinawalpoladivainagmail-com/ \"Posts by Thilina Walpola\")\n\n![](http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Johnston-2.jpg)\n\nJoseph Stalin\n\nFlawed, poorly planned and rushed education reforms could widen inequalities between urban and rural schools, teachers’ unions warned yesterday, criticising the government’s newly launched education reform programme, despite its formal inauguration earlier in the day.\n\nUnion leaders said essential resources needed to implement the reforms, including teachers’ guides, have yet to be issued, raising serious concerns over how educators are expected to deliver lessons under the new framework.\n\nThey urged the government and the Education Minister to suspend the rapid rollout of the reforms and undertake proper planning and consultations before implementing them nationwide.\n\nCeylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) Secretary, Joseph Stalin, addressing a press conference in Colombo on Thursday, cautioned that the reforms risk deepening existing disparities between urban and rural schools.\n\nHe drew attention to the new Grade 01 textbook, which reportedly includes 42 QR codes aimed at supporting digital learning. Stalin questioned the practicality of this approach for rural schools, where access to the internet and digital devices remains limited or non-existent.\n\n“How are children in rural schools expected to access these facilities when internet connectivity and digital devices are either unavailable or very poor?” he asked.\n\nStalin also raised concerns over the absence of a clear long-term vision behind the reforms, stating that even policymakers have failed to clearly articulate the academic or developmental outcomes students are expected to achieve by the time they complete Grade 13.\n\nTeacher preparedness was another major concern, he said, noting that educators assigned to teach under the new system have received training only for the first school term, while key instructional materials remain incomplete.\n\n“Teachers do not even have a proper printed teachers’ guide,” Stalin said, adding that the guide is currently available only online, making it further disadvantageous to schools with weak digital infrastructure.The unions warned that proceeding with the reforms under such conditions could undermine the quality of education and place both teachers and students at a disadvantage.\n\n[Continue Reading](http://island.lk/teacher-unions-cry-foul-over-muddled-educational-reforms/)\n\n### [News](http://island.lk/category/news/)\n\nIGP complains of

CID officers responded that the suspensions were based on an internal inquiry conducted by the Ministry of Education and involved the officials responsible for preparing the module.\n\nThe court further queried whether the incident resulted from professional negligence or a deliberate act. \n\nAccordingly, the magistrate directed the CID to obtain statements from teachers trained on the controversial module and also to determine whether there had been any misuse of public property.\n\nThe magistrate also stated that if there is any suspicion regarding the involvement of the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, he should be recorded as a witness.\n\nGangodawila Magistrate Ruwanthika Marasinghe ordered the CID to report progress of the investigation to court on February 20, 2026.\n\n[![](https://adaderana.lk/images/adv_derana/ADA-DERANA-WHATSAPP-ENGLISH.jpg)](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaE3fU190x2vveDVRg2q)\n\n**Disclaimer:** All the comments will be moderated by the AD editorial.

investments in crop cultivations with higher returns as many people had ended up in such unregulated investment to find out they are also similar to illegal pyramid schemes, Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said.\n\nIn recent years, Sri Lanka has witnessed a surge in unregulated investment schemes targeting agricultural lands, often luring investors with promises of land ownership and assured monthly incomes in signed agreements.\n\nThese ventures typically market themselves as opportunities to invest in commercial farming or eco-friendly projects, offering returns that appear attractive amidst the country’s economic challenges, analysts say.\n\nHowever, many of these schemes operate without proper regulatory oversight, raising concerns about their legitimacy and the protection of investors’ rights.\n\n“They (investment agents) claim that by cultivating various crops, they can give (higher) return,” he said,\n\n“For example, they say that by growing ni-miris (scotch bonnet pepper), you can earn a monthly interest of 30% or 40%. That means you can earn more than 120% annually. Therefore, people should realize that if such a profit can be made from an investment, they could do it themselves.”\n\n“There is no need to give your money to someone else to do it. However, we all know that this is practically impossible to achieve.”\n\nWeerasinghe said the Central Bank has observed an increasing trend of the public being lured toward fraudulent investment schemes in plantations and agriculture sectors.\n\n“The first thing to remember is that plantation investments are unregulated. If you lose your money, there is no regulatory authority to handle your complaint. This is an entirely unregulated sector,” Weerasinghe warned.\n\nHe said people are being promised of deeds for the cultivation they have invested after signing contracts, citing to protect individual investments.\n\nCurrently 18 individuals or organizations are being investigated related such investments which are considered as illegal deposits, he said.

They blame the country’s military chief, Field Marshall Asim Munir, a charge the government rejects. It says the meetings stopped because Khan broke jail rules prohibiting discussion of politics.\n\nWhile Khan may be silenced, he’s far from the only one under pressure.\n\nJournalists, analysts and human rights advocates say the space to disagree with the state is increasingly limited – and the risks greater.\n\nLast weekend, human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband were convicted of sharing anti-state social media posts.\n\nThe couple will spend 10 years in jail.\n\nAhead of sentencing, Amnesty International had called on Pakistan to end “coercive tactics used to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend human rights”.\n\n![AFP via Getty Images Human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari during an interview with AFP on 20 January 2026](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef35/live/5835a2a0-fd26-11f0-b7e1-afb6d0884c18.jpg.webp)\n\nKhan’s family are very clear about the effort to wipe him from the public’s mind.\n\n“There are two names you can’t have on television. You can’t say anything nice about Imran Khan, and you can’t say anything bad about Asim Munir,” his sister Aleema Khanum told the BBC. She was speaking at a recent protest by supporters a few kilometres from his cell in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.\n\nIt’s been more than eight weeks since Khan saw a family member, more than five since he met a lawyer and then it was only for eight minutes, his party says.  \n“This is the only way we have right now to create enough pressure that we are allowed to meet him,” Khanum said at the protest. “It’s his right to meet his lawyers, it’s his right to meet his family, it’s his communication with the outside world.”\n\nThat communication from Khan has often been highly critical of Pakistan’s government and military chief. After meetings inside the jail, Khan’s words have often been posted on his X account, attributed to him and giving directions to his party and supporters.\n\n“They are unable to block his voice because people want to hear him, they read his messages, they are not giving up on him,” Khanum says.  \nBut for now, with meetings stopped, so have those messages.\n\n![Aleema Khanum at a protest in support of her brother Imran Khan the week before last](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/716e/live/c30d3790-fd36-11f0-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp)\n\nKhan, imprisoned since August 2023, is convicted in several corruption cases which he says are politically motivated.\n\nThe government and military reject claims he is being held in isolation. Talal Chaudhry, an interior minister, has called him “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan”, with gym equipment and a cook.\n\nAfter a post appeared quoting Khan on his X account, calling Munir a “mentally unstable person”, the military spokesperson held a two-hour news conference broadcast across Pakistan’s media, saying Khan had gone beyond politics and labelled him a national security threat.\n\n“One could argue that the military is really leading the country on so many levels now that Pakistan’s coming quite close to authoritarian rule,” says Michael Kugelman, senior fellow on South Asia at the Atlantic Council.\n\n“This is the worst the repression has been during any period of civilian rule.”\n\nPakistan’s military, often referred to as “the establishment”, have been an ever-present factor in the country politics, including periods of military dictatorship.\n\nInitially, Khan and the military appeared close; many believe their backing helped bring Khan to power and the opposition at the time initially accused him of being in thrall to the military while he governed. Khan’s party denied this.\n\nBy the time he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in 2022, Khan had not only fallen out with the military leadership, but blamed them for his removal from power.\n\n![AFP via Getty Images Policemen detain Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party supporters during a protest against the 27th constitutional amendment, in Karachi on November 21, 2025.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b531/live/01e3c870-fd33-11f0-a8b8-bdd2c5f9bcad.png.webp)\n\nIn November 2025, a constitutional amendment granted Munir lifetime immunity from prosecution and oversight of all Pakistan’s defence forces.\n\nMany saw it as a further sign that the military’s influence over Pakistan was at a high-water mark under a civilian government.\n\nThe current government deny the military are calling the shots.\n\n“The civilian government is \\[taking\\] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry says, adding the chief of defence forces “is doing a marvellous job”.  \nSecurity sources said: “The military has always maintained it operates within legal bounds.”\n\nBut Michael Kugelman and others see a connection between the military’s involvement in politics and the amount of space to speak out.\n\n“It’s intrinsically linked to how strong or weak a democratic government is and what their relationship is with the military,” says Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and co-chair for the Human Rights Council of Pakistan (HRCP).\n\n“If the military is more dominant, there will be less space for protest, there will be less space for dissent, there will be less space for free expression.”\n\n![AFP via Getty Images People walk beside a poster featuring Pakistani Army Chief General Syed Asim Munir, along a road in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on May 14, 2025.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f163/live/614a8170-fd27-11f0-b7e1-afb6d0884c18.jpg.webp)\n\nOf those already jailed, Mazari is among the most prominent. A lawyer who has worked on some of the most sensitive cases in Pakistan, she and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were convicted of “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups”.\n\nThe government have defended their sentencing; in response Pakistan’s information minister posted on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”\n\n“Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.\n\nOther human rights advocates told the BBC they have faced limits on how they can operate.\n\nHRCP say that their staff have been harassed on phone calls and stopped from holding round-table discussions at hotels unless they obtain permission in advance. The government says this is “to ensure security”.\n\nJournalists, too, say they have felt pressure. In 2023, the BBC reported that TV channels had been told that they must not show Khan’s face, his voice or say his name. The topics that should not be covered, according to journalists the BBC spoke to, have expanded.\n\n“They \\[Pakistan’s authorities\\] have controlled the mainstream media to a large extent,” said Azaz Syed, a reporter for Geo TV. He says that even stories tangentially linked to the military – including one he recently did on a defence housing authority – have led to phone calls from unknown numbers with warnings to go no further.\n\nJahangir says she has even been told by editors not to cover certain stories.\n\n“The editors are not doing this for fun. They do fundamentally believe in freedom of expression. They are doing this in order to survive,” she says.\n\nJournalists from other outlets who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said that a culture of self-censorship was now common in newsrooms.\n\n“There were times in the past when there was complete censorship,” one said. “Now there is self-censorship, which in many ways is worse because we are deceiving the audience.”\n\nThe BBC approached the military for comment.\n\nSecurity sources told us that ISPR, the military’s communications arm, “does not regulate media content, freedom of speech, or interfere in civilian journalism, nor does it exercise any authority over public discourse beyond its lawful communication role”.\n\n![Bloomberg via Getty Images Imran Khan, Pakistan's former prime minister, in Lahore, Pakistan, on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e48/live/c4fe4c70-fd26-11f0-a8b8-bdd2c5f9bcad.jpg.webp)\n\nDawn newspaper – the oldest in Pakistan, founded in 1941 by the country’s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah – has taken a financial hit for its reporting. In December, Dawn Media Group said it had been subject to an unannounced ban on government adverts, firstly on its newspaper, then on its TV and radio outlets, a move the Council of Newspaper Editors said was “financially crippling the organisation”.\n\n“While some within the state may think that punishing outlets that refuse to toe the line may snuff out critical voices, in the modern age this is next to impossible,” the editorial board said.  \nInformation minister Atta Tarar denied that Dawn was denied government advertisement.\n\nSeveral journalists said that the changes to Pakistan’s Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in early 2025 have made the environment more difficult.\n\nPakistan’s authorities introduced the changes, saying they were needed to fight what the military has often termed “digital terrorism”; spreading what they see to be “anarchy and false information” to undermine the state. The country’s constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions, security sources told the BBC.\n\n“It’s false to claim Pakistan suppresses free speech,” says Chaudhry. He cites the dangers of social media being used for financial fraud and recruiting terrorists. “We want to regulate social media, the whole world is regulating \\[it\\].”\n\nBut others say they can be used to limit journalists’ ability to report.\n\n“Changes made to the law have now made it an explicit crime to criticise the security establishment, the judiciary and definitions around national interest have been made even more vague. There are astonishingly steep fines and the penalties have been enhanced disproportionately,” says Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst based in Islamabad.\n\nHe says there are the official rules, then there are further unspoken rules: “It’s really difficult to know what the boundaries are, they are forever shifting.”\n\nLimitations on journalists are not new in Pakistan. Under Khan’s government, journalists protested about restrictions placed on what they could publish and broadcast.\n\nSyed sees the current situation as a continuation of the operation against the media. Jahangir also sees some level of historical continuity. “I can’t say this has been the worst time, but let’s say that times haven’t improved for us.”\n\nWhile attempts to limit and intimidate critics have happened before, some think there is a new approach this time.\n\n“It feels like something has shifted,” says Azeema Cheema, an Islamabad-based research director specialising in conflict, fragility and violence. “Because now you are using the courts. You are using institutions, not extra institutional measures.”\n\nThose operating online outside Pakistan are in the authorities’ sights too. In early January, seven Pakistani journalists and Youtubers, including two former army officers, were tried in absentia and given life sentences for digital terrorism. The prosecution accused them of “waging war against state” and “incitement” in relation to protests that took place on 9 May 2023 after Khan’s first arrest.\n\nIn a post on X, one of the sentenced, Adil Raja, said “speaking truth to power is now called Digital Terrorism in Pakistan”.\n\nSyed and Cheema cite this case as a particularly stark example of harsh sentencing.\n\n“There’s been a growing realisation that the state is excessively willing and unapologetically willing to wield a blunt hammer,” says Cheema.\n\nWhere that hammer may fall next is what many we spoke to are trying to calculate.

after being steady at around 200 billion rupees monthly, a top Central Bank official said, amid an expected slowdown in economic activities after Cyclone Ditwah disaster.\n\nThe private credit volumes from commercial banks have slowed to 183 billion rupees in December 2025 from a new high of 262 billion rupees in the previous month.\n\nThe 12-month growth in the private sector credit growth also has fallen to 25.2 percent last month, compared to 26 percent in November 2025, official data showed.\n\n“We have seen notable expansion from June onwards by over 200 billion rupees a month, but some slow down observed in December as shown by provisional data to 183 billion,” S. Jegajeevan, Director of the Central Bank’s Economic Research Department told reporters on Wednesday (28).\n\nShe did not explain the reason for the slow down, but analysts attribute the slowdown to lower economic activities in December after the disaster late in November.\n\nJegajeevan said improving demand conditions as well as notable increase in vehicle imports led to strong private credit demand in the second half of 2025 with a slowdown in December.

The vast majority of rated sukuk are senior unsecured, but a rising share are subordinated, adding to the industry’s maturity. Maturity profiles skew towards medium-term sukuk.\n\nFitch rated Australia’s first sharia-compliant notes (Macquarie Group Limited, ‘A’), the UK’s first public sharia-compliant RMBS from a non-bank lender (Meridian Funding 2025-1 plc), and Sri Lanka’s first sukuk (Vidullanka PLC, ‘A+(lka)’). Fitch also rated the largest sukuk from Africa, issued by Egypt (‘B’), Turkiye’s first corporate sukuk (Turk Telekom), and first sukuk with payment-in-kind features. State investment funds also issued sukuk including the UAE’s Mubadala, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the Turkiye Wealth Fund. Fitch rates over 73% of outstanding US dollar sukuk, with vast majority denominated in dollars.\n\nFitch-rated sukuk outstanding rose 23% yoy to USD240 billion at end-2025, as global issuance surpassed USD300 billion – a 25% increase to record levels. Fitch expects issuance to slow during Ramadan in 1Q26. Most sukuk (39%) were rated in the ‘A’ category, followed by ‘BBB’ (26.2%) and ‘BB’ (10.5%).

Fitch also rated the largest sukuk from Africa, issued by Egypt (‘B’), Turkiye’s first corporate sukuk (Turk Telekom), and first sukuk with payment-in-kind features. State investment funds also issued sukuk including the UAE’s Mubadala, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the Turkiye Wealth Fund. Fitch rates over 73% of outstanding US dollar sukuk, with vast majority denominated in dollars.\n\nFitch-rated sukuk outstanding rose 23% yoy to USD240 billion at end-2025, as global issuance surpassed USD300 billion – a 25% increase to record levels. Fitch expects issuance to slow during Ramadan in 1Q26. Most sukuk (39%) were rated in the ‘A’ category, followed by ‘BBB’ (26.2%) and ‘BB’ (10.5%). Fitch upgraded Oman to ‘BBB-’ and Pakistan to ‘B-’ in 2025, with related sukuk upgrades.\n\nMost sukuk are asset-based, but asset-backed supply is growing, notably from supranational and UK issuers. Structures are predominantly bullet and fixed-rate, and about 12% are ESG sukuk.

The vast majority of rated sukuk are senior unsecured, but a rising share are subordinated, adding to the industry’s maturity. Maturity profiles skew towards medium-term sukuk.\n\nFitch rated Australia’s first sharia-compliant notes (Macquarie Group Limited, ‘A’), the UK’s first public sharia-compliant RMBS from a non-bank lender (Meridian Funding 2025-1 plc), and Sri Lanka’s first sukuk (Vidullanka PLC, ‘A+(lka)’). Fitch also rated the largest sukuk from Africa, issued by Egypt (‘B’), Turkiye’s first corporate sukuk (Turk Telekom), and first sukuk with payment-in-kind features. State investment funds also issued sukuk including the UAE’s Mubadala, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the Turkiye Wealth Fund. Fitch rates over 73% of outstanding US dollar sukuk, with vast majority denominated in dollars.\n\nFitch-rated sukuk outstanding rose 23% yoy to USD240 billion at end-2025, as global issuance surpassed USD300 billion – a 25% increase to record levels. Fitch expects issuance to slow during Ramadan in 1Q26. Most sukuk (39%) were rated in the ‘A’ category, followed by ‘BBB’ (26.2%) and ‘BB’ (10.5%). Fitch upgraded Oman to ‘BBB-’ and Pakistan to ‘B-’ in 2025, with related sukuk upgrades.\n\nMost sukuk are asset-based, but asset-backed supply is growing, notably from supranational and UK issuers. Structures are predominantly bullet and fixed-rate, and about 12% are ESG sukuk.

sixth reviews of the of the Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka, Mission Chief Evan Papageorgiou said after last review was delayed due to Cyclone Ditwah.\n\nCombining reviews is a “live discussion” he told reporters in Colombo after concluding a mission to assess the impact of Cyclone Ditwah.\n\nSri Lanka’s President’s media office said discussions related the of “the sixth tranche under the programme would resume in March.”\n\nEach review leads to the disbursement of 254 million special drawing rights (about 371 million dollars) at the current exchange rates making the total about 720 million US dollars if two reviews were completed together.\n\nThe staff level agreement and targets for Sri Lanka’s planned fifth review under the Extended Fund Facility in December 2025 became obsolete after spending in a budget for 2025 was increased by 500 billion rupees and economic projections became uncertain.\n\nThe fifth review was to be conducted on the fiscal and monetary targets applicable for June 2025.\n\nHowever, by March 2026, December targets would be available, under the applicable program before the staff level for the fifth review.\n\nSri Lanka has kept most quantitative targets for June and December, emerging data show.\n\nSri Lanka’s reserve collections reduced after a May rate cut and insufficient deflationary policy (sell downs of central bank held domestic assets) and unsterilized over-purchases led to currency depreciation.\n\nRELATED :\n\n[Sri Lanka to seek central bank dollars for debt repayment if IMF tranche

leads falling interest rates to a reduction in imports in the ensuing weeks helping build reserves.\n\nCredit came to a standstill in 2004 after the tsunami struck the island.\n\nThere were also foreign inflows as Ditwah aid which can strengthen the currency if the central bank did not buy them to create new money and was allowed to hit the market.

The vast majority of rated sukuk are senior unsecured, but a rising share are subordinated, adding to the industry’s maturity. Maturity profiles skew towards medium-term sukuk.\n\nFitch rated Australia’s first sharia-compliant notes (Macquarie Group Limited, ‘A’), the UK’s first public sharia-compliant RMBS from a non-bank lender (Meridian Funding 2025-1 plc), and Sri Lanka’s first sukuk (Vidullanka PLC, ‘A+(lka)’). Fitch also rated the largest sukuk from Africa, issued by Egypt (‘B’), Turkiye’s first corporate sukuk (Turk Telekom), and first sukuk with payment-in-kind features. State investment funds also issued sukuk including the UAE’s Mubadala, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the Turkiye Wealth Fund. Fitch rates over 73% of outstanding US dollar sukuk, with vast majority denominated in dollars.\n\nFitch-rated sukuk outstanding rose 23% yoy to USD240 billion at end-2025, as global issuance surpassed USD300 billion – a 25% increase to record levels. Fitch expects issuance to slow during Ramadan in 1Q26. Most sukuk (39%) were rated in the ‘A’ category, followed by ‘BBB’ (26.2%) and ‘BB’ (10.5%). Fitch upgraded Oman to ‘BBB-’ and Pakistan to ‘B-’ in 2025, with related sukuk upgrades.\n\nMost sukuk are asset-based, but asset-backed supply is growing, notably from supranational and UK issuers. Structures are predominantly bullet and fixed-rate, and about 12% are ESG sukuk.

resilience and credit quality in 2025, the rating agency said, with over 80 percent achieving investment grade, while simultaneously expanding into new geographies with first-time ratings in Australia, the UK, and Sri Lanka.\n\n“First-time Fitch-rated sukuk are emerging in markets such as Australia, the UK, and Sri Lanka, despite sukuk’s additional structural complexities,” said Bashar Al Natoor, Global Head of Islamic Finance at Fitch Ratings.\n\n“Over 80% of Fitch-rated sukuk were investment grade in 2025, with over 90% of issuers having Stable Outlooks, and no defaults over the past four years,” he added.\n\nSri Lanka’s first sukuk, by Vidullanka PLC, was rated ‘A+(lka)’) by Fitch.\n\nThe full statement is reproduced below:\n\n**Sukuk Expands to New Geographies, Sectors; Majority Investment Grade**\n\nFitch-rated sukuk are resilient, underpinned by robust credit quality, record issuance, and expansion across new regions and sectors.\n\n“First-time Fitch-rated sukuk are emerging in markets such as Australia, the UK, and Sri Lanka, despite sukuk’s additional structural complexities,” said Bashar Al Natoor, Global Head of Islamic Finance at Fitch Ratings. “Over 80% of Fitch-rated sukuk were investment grade in 2025, with over 90% of issuers having Stable Outlooks, and no defaults over the past four years,” he added.\n\nCoverage remains concentrated in the Middle East and Asia. The vast majority of rated sukuk are senior unsecured, but a rising share are subordinated, adding to the industry’s maturity. Maturity profiles skew towards medium-term sukuk.\n\nFitch rated Australia’s first sharia-compliant notes (Macquarie Group Limited, ‘A’), the UK’s first public sharia-compliant RMBS from a non-bank lender (Meridian Funding 2025-1 plc), and Sri Lanka’s first sukuk (Vidullanka PLC, ‘A+(lka)’). Fitch also rated the largest sukuk from Africa, issued by Egypt (‘B’), Turkiye’s first corporate sukuk (Turk Telekom), and first sukuk with payment-in-kind features. State investment funds also issued sukuk including the UAE’s Mubadala, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the Turkiye Wealth Fund. Fitch rates over 73% of outstanding US dollar sukuk, with vast majority denominated in dollars.\n\nFitch-rated sukuk outstanding rose 23% yoy to USD240 billion at end-2025, as global issuance surpassed USD300 billion – a 25% increase to record levels. Fitch expects issuance to slow during Ramadan in 1Q26. Most sukuk (39%) were rated in the ‘A’ category, followed by ‘BBB’ (26.2%) and ‘BB’ (10.5%). Fitch upgraded Oman to ‘BBB-’ and Pakistan to ‘B-’ in 2025, with related sukuk upgrades.\n\nMost sukuk are asset-based, but asset-backed supply is growing, notably from supranational and UK issuers. Structures are predominantly bullet and fixed-rate, and about 12% are ESG sukuk.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW). The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\n**REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING**  \nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-windforce-alka-rating-affirmed-by-fitch-259312/)\n\n[Economy](https://economynext.com/economy/)\n\nSri Lanka offers grants, low interest loans for businesses hit by Cyclone Ditwah\n================================================================================\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is offering grants of 25,000 to 200,000 rupees for micro and small enterprises affected by Cyclone Ditwah, up to 5 million rupees for commercial building repairs, and 3-5 percent interest loans with 10-year repayment options.\n\nThe president’s media division set out the ‘relief package’ as follows:\n\n**New Circular Issued to Support Disaster-Affected Micro, Small and Self-Employed Businesses**\n\n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered as businesses at Divisional Secretariat offices  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 for unregistered home-based businesses operating from permanent structures  \n– Rs. 50,000 Compensation Allocated for Unregistered Production Industries and Greenhouses  \n– Temporary Pedestrian and Mobile Business establishments to Receive Rs. 25,000 Compensation\n\nA new circular has been issued by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide relief to micro, small and self-employed businesses affected by the emergency situation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW). The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\n**REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING**  \nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-windforce-alka-rating-affirmed-by-fitch-259312/)\n\n[Economy](https://economynext.com/economy/)\n\nSri Lanka offers grants, low interest loans for businesses hit by Cyclone Ditwah\n================================================================================\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is offering grants of 25,000 to 200,000 rupees for micro and small enterprises affected by Cyclone Ditwah, up to 5 million rupees for commercial building repairs, and 3-5 percent interest loans with 10-year repayment options.\n\nThe president’s media division set out the ‘relief package’ as follows:\n\n**New Circular Issued to Support Disaster-Affected Micro, Small and Self-Employed Businesses**\n\n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered as businesses at Divisional Secretariat offices  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 for unregistered home-based businesses operating from permanent structures  \n– Rs. 50,000 Compensation Allocated for Unregistered Production Industries and Greenhouses  \n– Temporary Pedestrian and Mobile Business establishments to Receive Rs. 25,000 Compensation\n\nA new circular has been issued by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide relief to micro, small and self-employed businesses affected by the emergency situation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW). The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\n**REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING**  \nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-windforce-alka-rating-affirmed-by-fitch-259312/)\n\n[Economy](https://economynext.com/economy/)\n\nSri Lanka offers grants, low interest loans for businesses hit by Cyclone Ditwah\n================================================================================\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is offering grants of 25,000 to 200,000 rupees for micro and small enterprises affected by Cyclone Ditwah, up to 5 million rupees for commercial building repairs, and 3-5 percent interest loans with 10-year repayment options.\n\nThe president’s media division set out the ‘relief package’ as follows:\n\n**New Circular Issued to Support Disaster-Affected Micro, Small and Self-Employed Businesses**\n\n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered as businesses at Divisional Secretariat offices  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 for unregistered home-based businesses operating from permanent structures  \n– Rs. 50,000 Compensation Allocated for Unregistered Production Industries and Greenhouses  \n– Temporary Pedestrian and Mobile Business establishments to Receive Rs. 25,000 Compensation\n\nA new circular has been issued by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide relief to micro, small and self-employed businesses affected by the emergency situation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

begun issuing title deeds, after being taken over by Blackstone India, a statement said.\n\nThe high rise project promoted by Indocean Developers Pvt Ltd (IDPL), was mired in legal disputes before the Blackstone take-over.\n\nOver 100 individual title deeds were executed by apartment owners, providing owners with legal title to their apartments.\n\nThe process will be speeded in the future, the statement said.\n\n“Over the past six months, this process at Altair has moved forward in a structured and transparent manner, alongside the formal establishment of owner-led governance,” said Thilan Wijesinghe, Chairman of TWC Holdings, who, together with a team from TWC, represents Blackstone’s interests in Sri Lanka.\n\nAltair’s Management Council has been constituted, and the council appointed Realty Management Services (RMS), a subsidiary of Overseas Realty Ceylon PLC, as the new facility manager of Altair.\n\n“The appointment of experienced facility managers are fundamental building block for long-term value-creation for apartment owners and proper asset stewardship,” Wijesinghe said.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW). The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\n**REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING**  \nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-windforce-alka-rating-affirmed-by-fitch-259312/)\n\n[Economy](https://economynext.com/economy/)\n\nSri Lanka offers grants, low interest loans for businesses hit by Cyclone Ditwah\n================================================================================\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is offering grants of 25,000 to 200,000 rupees for micro and small enterprises affected by Cyclone Ditwah, up to 5 million rupees for commercial building repairs, and 3-5 percent interest loans with 10-year repayment options.\n\nThe president’s media division set out the ‘relief package’ as follows:\n\n**New Circular Issued to Support Disaster-Affected Micro, Small and Self-Employed Businesses**\n\n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered as businesses at Divisional Secretariat offices  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 for unregistered home-based businesses operating from permanent structures  \n– Rs. 50,000 Compensation Allocated for Unregistered Production Industries and Greenhouses  \n– Temporary Pedestrian and Mobile Business establishments to Receive Rs. 25,000 Compensation\n\nA new circular has been issued by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide relief to micro, small and self-employed businesses affected by the emergency situation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

In the nine months to December the country’s top market heavyweight reported earnings of 0.41 cents per share, on total profits of 7.3 billion rupees, which was up 119 percent.\n\nJKH group revenues rose 54 percent to 125 billion rupees in the September quarter, cost of sales rose 52 percent to 98.3 billion rupees and gross profit rose 62 percent to 26 billion rupees.\n\nRevenue and earnings before interest tax and depreciation was primarily driven by electric and hybrid vehicle sales, financial services and City of Dreams Sri Lanka which recorded a positive EBITDA of 1.4 billion rupees, against a negative 1.6 billion a year ago, Chairman Krishan Balendra told shareholders in the earnings report.\n\nThis positive EBITDA, includes fair value gains made on investment property, as opposed to the previous year’s negative EBITDA, which did not include fair value gains.\n\nThe casino has also had steady gains, with JKH recognising fixed rental incomes from it for the full quarter. Variable rental incomes will be considered once casino revenue reaches a certain target, the company said.\n\nFollowing a customs dispute over the motor capacity of imported BYDs, JKH halted the delivery of the vehicles and filed a lawsuit against Sri Lanka Customs.\n\nThese vehicles have subsequently been released, save for ones held back for testing. While awaiting a conclusion on this matter, JKH has ramped up its focus on hybrid vehicles. Over 3900 vehicles await their delivery over the preceding months, the conglomerate said.\n\n“JKCG (John Keells CG Auto) has fully cooperated with the authorities and continues to advocate carrying out independent testing at an internationally accredited motor laboratory,” Balendra said.  \n\n“We remain committed and resolute in our efforts to arrive at an expeditious permanent solution to this matter, so as to ensure our prospective customers have the benefit of a wider choice in deciding their purchase of BYDs expansive range of vehicles.”\n\n“JKCG has concurrently ramped up its focus on the hybrid segment offered by BYD and has also seen strong interest for these models.”\n\nThe Colombo West International Terminal also showed steady month-on-month growth, recording positive profit after tax, surpassing expectations.

December, after Cyclone Ditwah devastation in November despite hotel damage being minimal, Krishan Balendra, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.\n\n“For tourism, I feel that in December, there would have been a 5 percent to 10 percent impact on booking,” Balendra told an economic forum on Wednesday organized by Asia Securities.\n\nIn late 2025, Cyclone Ditwah delivered a sharp but localized blow to Sri Lanka’s tourism sector, striking at the onset of the peak travel season.\n\n“In tourism, there were two aspects: the impact on bookings and infrastructure damage,” Balendra said.\n\n“Tourist hotels association collected information from member companies and found the total damage was about 500 million rupees, again, not a material number at all.”\n\nThe disaster caused damage to infrastructure in the central highlands, leading to the temporary closure of iconic UNESCO World Heritage sites like Horton Plains and causing an estimated 18-month disruption to the world-famous Kandy-Ella railway line.\n\nWhile nature-based tourism in the hill country faced the brunt of the storm, major coastal hubs and the Cultural Triangle remained largely operational.\n\nDespite an estimated 4.1 billion dollars in total national damage, the tourism industry has shown resilience; the sector recorded a 9.7 percent growth in arrivals in early 2026 compared to the previous year.

The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW). The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.\n\n**REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING**  \nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://economynext.com/sri-lankas-windforce-alka-rating-affirmed-by-fitch-259312/)\n\n[Economy](https://economynext.com/economy/)\n\nSri Lanka offers grants, low interest loans for businesses hit by Cyclone Ditwah\n================================================================================\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nThursday January 29, 2026 11:13 am\n\nECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka is offering grants of 25,000 to 200,000 rupees for micro and small enterprises affected by Cyclone Ditwah, up to 5 million rupees for commercial building repairs, and 3-5 percent interest loans with 10-year repayment options.\n\nThe president’s media division set out the ‘relief package’ as follows:\n\n**New Circular Issued to Support Disaster-Affected Micro, Small and Self-Employed Businesses**\n\n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 200,000 for micro, small and self-employed businesses registered as businesses at Divisional Secretariat offices  \n– Financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 for unregistered home-based businesses operating from permanent structures  \n– Rs. 50,000 Compensation Allocated for Unregistered Production Industries and Greenhouses  \n– Temporary Pedestrian and Mobile Business establishments to Receive Rs. 25,000 Compensation\n\nA new circular has been issued by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide relief to micro, small and self-employed businesses affected by the emergency situation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

National Long-Term Rating at ‘A+'(lka), with a stable outlook, based on its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in the island and several regional markets.\n\n“WindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs),” Fitch Ratings said.\n\nHowever, the rating agency [pointed out](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-sri-lanka-windforce-at-a-lka-outlook-stable-26-01-2026)\n that WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Fitch statement is reproduced below:\n\n**Fitch Affirms Sri Lanka’s WindForce at ‘A+(lka)’; Outlook Stable**\n\nFitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based power generator WindForce PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘A+'(lka). The Outlook is Stable.\n\nWindForce’s rating reflects its growing scale as a prominent renewable power generator in Sri Lanka and several regional markets, its resource diversity and contractual cashflows via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB, A(lka)/Stable), which is a key off-taker accounting for over 80% of WindForce’s EBIT.\n\nFitch forecasts WindForce’s EBITDA net leverage to rise in the financial year ending March 2027 (FY27) on high debt-funded capex for new generation plants and reduce thereafter as the new plants are commissioned, driving the Stable Outlook. However, inability to deleverage in FY28 in line with our expectations could pressure WindForce’s rating.\n\n**Key Rating Drivers**\n\n**Temporarily High Leverage on Capex:** WindForce expects capex of over LKR40 billion for solar and wind power plants in the next two years with most outflows in FY27. This includes a 100MW solar plant with integrated battery storage, which is Sri Lanka’s largest renewable energy project, under a joint venture with Lakdhanavi Ltd (AA-(lka)/Stable). Fitch estimates WindForce’s generation capacity to rise to over 200MW by FY28 as a result.\n\nEBITDA net leverage will rise to around 6.8x in FY27, before moderating to around 4.6x by FY28 as the plants are commissioned. Execution risks for these projects are low, supported by the company’s record in similar projects, the limited construction complexity of solar and wind projects, the requisite regulatory approvals and offtake agreements in place, with transmission lines constructed or right-of-way established. Additionally, the plants’ long-term PPAs with CEB are in place at preset tariffs, mitigating demand risk.\n\n**Counterparty Constrains Rating:** WindForce’s rating is constrained by the credit profile of CEB, the sole electricity transmitter and distributor in Sri Lanka, despite CEB’s improved financial performance. CEB’s rating depends on support from the Sri Lankan sovereign (Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): CCC+; Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: CCC+).. WindForce derived around 70% of its EBIT from CEB in FY23-FY25, with the share rising to around 80% in FY25 after the commissioning of the Kebitigollewa solar project. We expect WindForce’s cash flow exposure to CEB to increase in FY26-FY29 once new projects are commissioned.\n\n**Risks to Cost-Reflective Tariffs:** Fitch sees risks to CEB’s implementation of cost-reflective tariffs, which could weigh on its balance sheet and pressure settlements to domestic power producers. This is due to the government’s competing priorities of managing inflation, CEB’s financial health, and the state’s own finances. CEB’s EBIT turned negative in 1Q25 due to costs rising faster than approved tariff increases. However, tariff revisions since have improved CEB’s EBIT to breakeven levels in 9M25. WindForce’s average receivable days are steady at around 40 as of 30 September 2025, compared to the peak of around 350 days in FY23.\n\n**Steady EBITDA Margin:** We expect EBITDA margins to improve from around 65% in FY25 to around 70% in FY26-FY28. This reflects operating expenses normalising following increased repairs and maintenance at wind plants, which were deferred from previous years. WindForce’s PPAs offer long-term cash flow visibility, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of over 10 years, but generation volume can be affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. This is mitigated by its diversified portfolio, comprising wind (74MW), solar (55MW) and hydro (15MW) , totaling 145MW, on an alternating current equivalent basis (AC), across 23 power plants excluding associates and joint ventures.\n\n**Peer Analysis**\n\nWindForce is rated one notch below domestic power producer and engineering, procurement and construction contractor Lakdhanavi. The difference is on account of Lakdhanavi’s larger operating scale as a critical base-load power generator in Sri Lanka as well as its higher geographic and business diversification.\n\nBoth Lakdhanavi and WindForce have significant exposure to CEB. However, Lakdhanavi also has operations and maintenance (O&M) services, manufactures transformers and switchgears, and offers galvanising services, which provides a degree of diversification. We also believe CEB is likely to prioritise payments to Lakdhanavi even in situations where its own financial profile is stretched, given Lakdhanavi provides O&M services to one of Sri Lanka’s largest power plants, and is investing in a large liquefied natural gas power plant, all of which are critical to Sri Lanka’s power generation and to CEB’s future strategy.\n\nResus Energy PLC (A-(lka)/Stable), a domestic power producer, is rated two notches below WindForce. Resus also benefits from contractual revenue visibility via its PPAs with CEB. However, Resus’ lower rating reflects its tighter liquidity than WindForce and smaller operating scale with narrower access to domestic banks.\n\nVidullanka PLC (A+(lka)/Stable) is rated at the same level as WindForce. WindForce has larger operating capacity than Vidullanka and more diversified power generation resources. This is counterbalanced by Vidullanka’s exposure to the state-owned utility of Uganda (B/Stable) and concentration in hydropower generation. Most of Vidullanka’s cash flow stems from overseas, while most of its debt is onshore with Sri Lankan banks, exposing the company to potential repatriation risks. However, Vidullanka’s track record of overseas receipts has been steady.\n\n**Fitch’s Key Rating-Case Assumptions**\n\nRevenue to remain flat in FY26 then increase by over 30% annually in FY27 and FY28 from new projects\n\nEBITDA margin of around 70% in FY26 and FY27;\n\nReceivable days steady at around 40\n\nCapex of around LKR15 billion in FY26 and around LKR30 billion in FY27\n\nDividend payout of 80% of prior year profit.\n\n**RATING SENSITIVITIES**\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade**  \nEBITDA net leverage above 5.0x for a sustained period;  \nEBITDA interest coverage below 1.5x for a sustained period.\n\n**Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade**  \nA sustained and substantial reduction in counterparty risk, as reflected in a continued improvement in CEB’s credit profile.\n\n**Liquidity and Debt Structure**\n\nWindForce’s liquidity is subject to timely collection of dues from CEB. The company reported over LKR1.3 billion of readily available cash as of 30 September 2025 and had access to around LKR7 billion in unutilised, albeit uncommitted, credit lines from local banks against LKR1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. Maturing debt mainly comprises the current portion of long-term debt obtained to fund the investments in its power plants.\n\nWe expect the company to generate negative FCF in the near-to-medium term due to high capex. However, WindForce has adequate access to domestic banks, as most banks are willing to provide longer-tenured facilities for the company’s operating power plants that have more than 10 years remaining under their PPAs.\n\n**Issuer Profile**\n\nWindForce is a leading renewable power producer in Sri Lanka with a total installed power generation capacity of around 145MW (excluding associates and joint ventures) as of 31 March 2025. Most of the installed capacity is in Sri Lanka (132MW), with the rest in Uganda (13MW).

In the nine months to December the country’s top market heavyweight reported earnings of 0.41 cents per share, on total profits of 7.3 billion rupees, which was up 119 percent.\n\nJKH group revenues rose 54 percent to 125 billion rupees in the September quarter, cost of sales rose 52 percent to 98.3 billion rupees and gross profit rose 62 percent to 26 billion rupees.\n\nRevenue and earnings before interest tax and depreciation was primarily driven by electric and hybrid vehicle sales, financial services and City of Dreams Sri Lanka which recorded a positive EBITDA of 1.4 billion rupees, against a negative 1.6 billion a year ago, Chairman Krishan Balendra told shareholders in the earnings report.\n\nThis positive EBITDA, includes fair value gains made on investment property, as opposed to the previous year’s negative EBITDA, which did not include fair value gains.\n\nThe casino has also had steady gains, with JKH recognising fixed rental incomes from it for the full quarter. Variable rental incomes will be considered once casino revenue reaches a certain target, the company said.\n\nFollowing a customs dispute over the motor capacity of imported BYDs, JKH halted the delivery of the vehicles and filed a lawsuit against Sri Lanka Customs.\n\nThese vehicles have subsequently been released, save for ones held back for testing. While awaiting a conclusion on this matter, JKH has ramped up its focus on hybrid vehicles. Over 3900 vehicles await their delivery over the preceding months, the conglomerate said.\n\n“JKCG (John Keells CG Auto) has fully cooperated with the authorities and continues to advocate carrying out independent testing at an internationally accredited motor laboratory,” Balendra said.  \n\n“We remain committed and resolute in our efforts to arrive at an expeditious permanent solution to this matter, so as to ensure our prospective customers have the benefit of a wider choice in deciding their purchase of BYDs expansive range of vehicles.”\n\n“JKCG has concurrently ramped up its focus on the hybrid segment offered by BYD and has also seen strong interest for these models.”\n\nThe Colombo West International Terminal also showed steady month-on-month growth, recording positive profit after tax, surpassing expectations.
